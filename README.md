Zomatoverse Project
Overview
This project analyzes Zomato's dataset to extract meaningful insights, identify trends, and present actionable recommendations. The primary goal is to explore customer preferences, restaurant performance, and regional trends to assist stakeholders in making data-driven decisions.

Dataset
The dataset includes information on:

Restaurant names, cuisines, and locations
Average cost for two people
Customer ratings and reviews
Delivery availability
Regional data (cities, localities, etc.)
Objectives
Analyze Trends:
Popular cuisines in different regions
Price distribution across various restaurant categories
Performance Metrics:
Identifying high-rated and low-rated restaurants
Exploring the relationship between price and customer ratings
Regional Analysis:
Comparing restaurants across cities
Discovering location-based preferences for cuisines
Customer Insights:
Understanding user review patterns
Identifying peak order times and popular dining preferences
Tools & Technologies
